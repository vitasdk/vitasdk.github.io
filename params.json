  "body": "Vita SDK is an open source toolchain for PlayStation&reg; Vita development. This allows you to create applications, games, and more (homebrew) to run on hacked Vita consoles. You can find more information on the hack [here](https://henkaku.xyz/).\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\n## Prerequisite\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nInstall the following (adapt the command for your system): `apt-get install make git-core cmake`\r\n\r\n### OSX\r\n\r\n1. Install XCode Command Line Tools with `xcode-select --install`\r\n2. Install either [brew](http://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org)\r\n3. Run either `brew install wget cmake` or `port install wget cmake`.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nIf you have [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide), then the recommended way is to follow the Linux directions above. Otherwise, continue reading.\r\n\r\n1. Install [msys2](http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/msys2-x86_64-latest.exe)\r\n2. Run msys2 shell and install the dependencies: `pacman -Su make git cmake tar mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-libwinpthread-git`\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nSet the environment variable `VITASDK` to be the install destination for Vita SDK. We recommend using `/usr/local/vitasdk`. We also recommend making the change to your `.bashrc` or equivalent (`.bash_profile` on OSX) since using the toolchain requires `VITASDK` to be set.\r\n```\r\nexport VITASDK=/usr/local/vitasdk\r\nexport PATH=$VITASDK/bin:$PATH # add vitasdk tool to $PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\nDownload the [host package manager](https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm) and install to `$VITASDK`\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm\r\ncd vdpm\r\ncp config.sample config\r\n./bootstrap-vitasdk.sh\r\n./install-all.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install the toolchain and the most common libraries (including zlib, freetype, [libvita2d](https://github.com/xerpi/libvita2d) and more).\r\n\r\n## Updating\r\n\r\nRight now, there is no easy flow for updating the toolchain. You can download the latest [autobuild](https://github.com/vitasdk/autobuilds/releases) and extract it to `$VITASDK`, replacing the current installation. Your installed static libraries should not be affected. You can also update individual packages and install new ones using [vdpm](https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm).\r\n\r\n## Removing\r\n\r\nTo remove all traces of Vita SDK, just delete your `$VITASDK` directory. You can then reverse the steps in installing the prerequisite.\r\n\r\n# Platform\r\n\r\n## Writing Code\r\n\r\nThe [APIs](https://docs.vitasdk.org/) are gathered from revering the Vita's firmware. It includes everything you can do with the system. It is recommended that you start by cloning the [samples](https://github.com/vitasdk/samples) and by reading through them and understanding them. The environment is POSIX but the true power comes from the Sony specific [APIs](https://docs.vitasdk.org/).\r\n\r\n### Plugins and Extensions\r\n\r\nIt is highly recommend that you are familiar with writing homebrews before attempting to write a plugin, which is significantly more difficult to do. Advanced developers can check out [taiHEN](https://tai.henkaku.xyz/) for a substrate that allows you to hook system functions.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nBuilding is done with CMake and you should familiarize yourself with the [hello world CMake file](https://github.com/vitasdk/samples/blob/master/hello_world/CMakeLists.txt) to better understand how it works. SELF is the executable format that the Vita runs and the included CMake macro `vita_create_self` will build it for you. VPK is the homebrew package format and is an archive of the SELF along with data files and LiveArea and is done by the CMake macro `vita_create_vpk`. VPK is what is installed to the Vita as a bubble.\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nTo run homebrew, you need a hacked Vita or PS TV. Currently the only hack is [HENkaku](https://henkaku.xyz/) which requires firmware 3.60. Once you installed HENkaku, open up molecularShell and copy your built VPK to `ux0:data` through FTP. You can then install it as a bubble.\r\n\r\n## Debugging\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is minimal debugging support. If your app crashes, a core dump will be generated in `ux0:data`. You can then [parse the core dump](https://github.com/xyzz/vita-parse-core) to figure out what caused the crash. If you would like to help contribute to the Vita SDK project, we would love to have a debugger for the system.\r\n\r\n# Community\r\n\r\nThanks to the [Vita SDK team](https://github.com/orgs/vitasdk/people) for creating everything! The logo was designed by [@Acemad_](https://twitter.com/Acemad_).\r\n\r\nYou can find most of us in the [#vitasdk](irc://chat.freenode.net/vitasdk) room in FreeNode IRC. If you have any questions or need any help, don't hesitate to ask! We also have a [forums](https://forums.vitasdk.org/) for discussions and a [wiki](https://wiki.henkaku.xyz/) for details on reversing engineering the Vita.\r\n",
